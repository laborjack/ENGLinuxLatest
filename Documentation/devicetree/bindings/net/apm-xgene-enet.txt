APM X-Gene SoC Ethernet nodes

Ethernet nodes are defined to describe on-chip ethernet interfaces in
APM X-Gene SoC.

Required properties:
- compatible:		Should be "apm,xgene-enet"
- reg:			First resource is the ethernet base register set
			Second resource is the ring base register set
			Third resource is the ring command register set
- interrupts:		Ethernet main interrupt
- clocks:		Reference to the clock entry.
- local-mac-address:	Ethernet MAC address.
- phy-connection-type:	Ethernet MII mode.

- mdio device tree subnode: When the X-Gene SoC has a phy connected to its local
		mdio, there must be device tree subnode with the following
		required properties:

	- compatible: Must be "apm,xgene-mdio".
	- #address-cells: Must be <1>.
	- #size-cells: Must be <0>.

	For the phy on the mdio bus, there must be a node with the following
	fields:

	- reg: phy id used to communicate to phy.

Optional properties:
- status		: Should be "ok" or "disabled" for enabled/disabled.
			  Default is "ok".

Example:
	menetclk: menetclk {
		compatible = "apm,xgene-device-clock";
		clock-output-names = "menetclk";
		status = "ok";
	};

	menet: ethernet@17020000 {
		compatible = "apm,xgene-enet";
		status = "disabled";
		reg = <0x0 0x17020000 0x0 0xd100>,
		      <0x0 0X17030000 0x0 0X400>,
		      <0x0 0X10000000 0x0 0X200>;
		interrupts = <0x0 0x3c 0x4>;
		clocks = <&menetclk 0>;
		local-mac-address = [00 01 73 00 00 01];
		phy-connection-type = "rgmii";
		phy-handle = <&menetphy>;
		mdio {
			compatible = "apm,xgene-mdio";
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;
			menetphy: menetphy@3 {
				reg = <0x3>;
			};

		};
	};

/* Board-specific peripheral configurations */

&menet {
        status = "ok";
};
