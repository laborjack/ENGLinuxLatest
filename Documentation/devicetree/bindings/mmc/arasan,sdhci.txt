Device Tree Bindings for the Arasan SDHCI Controller

  The bindings follow the mmc[1], clock[2] and interrupt[3] bindings. Only
  deviations are documented here.

  [2] Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt
  [3] Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt

Required Properties:
  - compatible: Compatibility string. Must be 'arasan,sdhci-8.9a' or
                'apm,arasan,sdhci-8.9a'
  - reg: First resource is the SDHC register location and length.
         Second optional resource is the bridge translation register location
         and length if required.
  - interrupts: Interrupt specifier
  - interrupt-parent: Phandle for the interrupt controller that services
		      interrupts for this device.

Optional Properties:
  - clocks: For format, refer to clock bindings. It requires two clocks if
            specified - AHB clock and SDHC clock.
  - clock-names: For format, refer to clock bindings. The clock corresponding
                 to the AHBC clock must be named "clk_ahb". The clock
                 corresponding to the SDHC clock must be named "clk_xin".

Example:
	sdhci@e0100000 {
		compatible = "arasan,sdhci-8.9a";
		reg = <0xe0100000 0x1000>;
		clock-names = "clk_xin", "clk_ahb";
		clocks = <&clkc 21>, <&clkc 32>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
		interrupts = <0 24 4>;
	} ;
