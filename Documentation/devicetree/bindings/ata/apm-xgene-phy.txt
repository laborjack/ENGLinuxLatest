* APM X-Gene 6.0 Gb/s SATA PHY nodes

SATA PHY nodes are defined to describe on-chip Serial ATA PHY. Each SATA PHY
(pair of PHY) has its own node.

Required properties:
- compatible		: Shall be "apm,xgene-ahci-phy" or
			  "apm,xgene-ahci-phy2". The "apm,xgene-ahci-phy"
			  describes an port shared with SGMII Ethernet port.
			  The "apm,xgene-ahci-phy2" describes an port not
			  shared with SGMII and the PLL located at another
			  memory resource region.
- reg			: First PHY memory resource
			  Second separate PHY PLL clock memory resource if
			  type "apm,xgene-ahci-phy2"
- #phy-cells		: Shall be 0

Optional properties:
- status		: Shall be "ok" if enabled or "na" if disabled. Default
			  is "ok".
- txeyetuning		: Manual control to fine tune the capture of the serial
			  bit lines from the automatic calibrated position.
			  Two set of 3-tuple setting for Gen1, Gen2, and Gen3.
			  Range from 0 to 0x7f. Default is 0xa.
- txeyedirection	: Eye tuning manual control direction. 0 means sample
			  data earlier than the nominal sampling point. 1 means
			  sample data later than the nominal sampling point.
			  Two set of 3-tuple setting for Gen1, Gen2, and Gen3.
			  Default is 0x0.
- txboostgain		: Frequency boost and DC gain control. Two set of
			  3-tuple setting for Gen1, Gen2, and Gen3. Range is
			  between 0 to 0x1f. Default is 0x3.
- txspeed		: Tx operating speed. Two set of 3-tuple for
			  Gen1 (0x1), Gen2 (0x3), and Gen3 (0x7). Default is
			  0x7.

NOTE: PHY override parameters are board specific setting.

Example:
		sataphy0: sataphy@1f210000 {
			compatible = "apm,xgene-ahci-phy";
			reg = <0x0 0x1f210000 0x0 0x10000>;
			#phy-cells = <0>;
			status = "na";
		};

		sataphy1: sataphy@1f220000 {
			compatible = "apm,xgene-ahci-phy";
			reg = <0x0 0x1f220000 0x0 0x10000>;
			#phy-cells = <0>;
			status = "ok";
		};

		sataphy2: sataphy@1f230000 {
			compatible = "apm,xgene-ahci-phy2";
			reg = <0x0 0x1f230000 0x0 0x10000
			       0x0 0x1f2d0000 0x0 0x10000 >;
			#phy-cells = <0>;
			status = "ok";
		};
