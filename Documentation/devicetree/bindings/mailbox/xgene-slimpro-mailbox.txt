The APM X-Gene SLIMpro mailbox driver is used to communicate messages between
the ARM64 processors and the Cortex M3 (dubbed SLIMpro). It uses a simple
interrupt based door bell mechanism and can exchange simple messages using the
internal registers.

There are total of 8 interrupts in this mailbox. Each used for an individual
door bell (or mailbox channel).

Required properties:
- compatible:	Should be as "apm, xgene-slimpro-mbox".

- reg:		Contain the mailbox register address range.

- interrupts:	Contain interrupt information for the mailbox device.

- #mbox-cells:	Specify the number of parameters used by the mailbox client.
		Currently only one to specify the mailbox channel number.

Example:

Mailbox Node:
		mailbox: slimpro-mailbox@10540000 {
			compatible = "apm,xgene-slimpro-mbox";
			reg = <0x0 0x10540000 0x0 0xa000>;
			#mbox-cells = <1>;
			interrupts =  	<0x0 0x0 0x4>,
					<0x0 0x1 0x4>,
					<0x0 0x2 0x4>,
					<0x0 0x3 0x4>,
					<0x0 0x4 0x4>,
					<0x0 0x5 0x4>,
					<0x0 0x6 0x4>,
					<0x0 0x7 0x4>;
		};

Client Node:
		i2cslimpro {
			compatible = "apm,xgene-slimpro-i2c";
			mbox = <&mailbox 0>;
			mbox-names = "i2c-slimpro";
		};
